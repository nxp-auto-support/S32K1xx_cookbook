 * Description:
 * ==================================================================================
 * The FlexIO is a highly configurable module providing a wide range of functionality.
 * This example configures two timers and one pin to emulate:
	• PWM signal at 100KHz, duty cycle as Init function parameter.
	• UART 8-bits Transfer at 19200 b/s (polling technique).
