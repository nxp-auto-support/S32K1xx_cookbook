 * Description:
 * ============================================================================================================
 * A FlexCAN module is initialized for 500 KHz (2 usec period) bit time based on an 8 MHz crystal. 
 * Message buffer 0 transmits 8 byte messages and message buffer 4 can receive 8 byte messages.
 * To enable signals to the CAN bus, the SBC must be powered with external 12 V. EVBs with SBC
 * MC33903 require CAN transceiver configuration with SPI. EVBs with SBC UJA1169 do not require configuration.
 * 
 * By default, the example configures for SBC MC33903 and “Node A” IDs. If a second EVB or CAN tool
 * is available, “Node B” IDs can be used for the tool or second EVB. FlexCAN.h file contains controls for
 * initializing Node A vs B and selecting SBC MC33903.
