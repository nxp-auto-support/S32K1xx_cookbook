 * Description:
 * =============================================================================================
 * Initialize an eDMA channel’s Transfer Control Descriptor (TCD) to transfer a string of bytes
 * (“Hello world”) from an array in SRAM to a single SRAM byte location. This emulates a common 
 * use of DMA, where a string of data or commands is transferred automatically under DMA control 
 * to an input register of a peripheral. The intent of this example is to illustrate how to set 
 * up a DMA transfer.
