 * Description:
 * =============================================================================================
 * This project intends to show the Linking Channel Feature of the DMA where you can set up a link
 * so when a channel finishes a major or minor loop it activates another DMA channel and send
 * information from different sources or to different destinations or both. In this case we use it to link
 * CH0 to CH1 after CH0's major loop to copy the phrase "Hello World" from one string to another.
