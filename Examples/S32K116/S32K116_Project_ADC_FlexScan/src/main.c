 * Description:
 * ======================================================================================================================
 * This example intends to show how to combine ADC, DMA and PDB to implement an ADC flexible storage.
 * In this project, PDB triggers ADC0 CH0 measurements which will be saved inside an internal memory buffer through DMA,
 * this way the MCU doesn't need to read the ADC result register because the transfers will be done by DMA.
