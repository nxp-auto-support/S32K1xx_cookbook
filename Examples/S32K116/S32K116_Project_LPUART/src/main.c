 * Description:
 * ==========================================================================================
 * This example performs a simple UART transfer to a COM port on a PC. FIFOs, interrupts and
 * DMA are not implemented. The Open SDA interface can be used on the evaluation board, where 
 * the UART signals are transferred to a USB interface, which can connect to a PC which has a 
 * terminal emulation program such as PUTTY, TeraTerm or other software.
